# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to create more animations in the future for things like buttons and links. For example, with the "Book a table" button, it would be nice to have it look like a button when pressed. I would impliment this by changing its box-shadow styles for the base class and the :hover class so that it looks like the button is being physically pressed.  
Regarding some bigger projects that I might learn later, I could set up a system for the customer that would allow them to place a delivery order within the website. They would be able to do this with a new section, or start by clicking on any of the items on the menu, which would begin they're order with that item.
